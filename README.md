The Stopaholic project is a way for users to save money each month by keeping track of what they didn't buy. Instead of buying something as soon as you see it Stopaholic is there to add the item to the monthly list to keep track of how much you didn't spend. At the end of month users can move all that saved money to savings, add it to a debt payment or buy a couple of things off their list.
